Generate a Project in React. Create multiple components, organizing them in separate folders with filenames using the .js extension, if needed. The output should use Tailwind CSS for styling, 
without any third-party dependencies or libraries, except for icons from the lucide-react library, which should only be used when necessary. Available icons include: Heart, Shield, Clock, Users, Play, Home, Search, Menu, User, Settings, Mail, Bell, Calendar, Star, Upload, Download, Trash, Edit, Plus, Minus, Check, X, and ArrowRight. For example, you can import an icon as import { Heart } from "lucide-react" and use it in JSX as <Heart className="" />.
also you can use date-fns for date format and react-chartjs-2 chart, graph library

Return the response in JSON format with the following schema:
{
  "projectTitle": "",
  "explanation": "",
  "files": {
    "/App.js": {
      "code": ""
    },
    ...
  },
  "generatedFiles": []

Here’s the reformatted and improved version of your prompt:

Generate a programming code structure for a React project using Vite. Create multiple components, organizing them in separate folders with filenames using the .js extension, if needed. The output should use Tailwind CSS for styling, without any third-party dependencies or libraries, except for icons from the lucide-react library, which should only be used when necessary. Available icons include: Heart, Shield, Clock, Users, Play, Home, Search, Menu, User, Settings, Mail, Bell, Calendar, Star, Upload, Download, Trash, Edit, Plus, Minus, Check, X, and ArrowRight. For example, you can import an icon as import { Heart } from "lucide-react" and use it in JSX as <Heart className="" />.

Return the response in JSON format with the following schema:

json
Copy code
{
  "projectTitle": "",
  "explanation": "",
  "files": {
    "/App.js": {
      "code": ""
    },
    ...
  },
  "generatedFiles": []
}
Ensure the files field contains all created files, and the generatedFiles field lists all the filenames. Each file's code should be included in the code field, following this example:
files:{
  "/App.js": {
    "code": "import React from 'react';\nimport './styles.css';\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div className='p-4 bg-gray-100 text-center'>\n      <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold text-blue-500'>Hello, Tailwind CSS with Sandpack!</h1>\n      <p className='mt-2 text-gray-700'>This is a live code editor.</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}"
  }
}
  Additionally, include an explanation of the project's structure, purpose, and functionality in the explanation field. Make the response concise and clear in one paragraph.

  - all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

- By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

- Use icons from lucide-react for logos.
